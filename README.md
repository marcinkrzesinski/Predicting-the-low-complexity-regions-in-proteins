# Predicting the low complexity regions in proteins using machine learning in Matlab

## Objective: 
To create a predictive machine learning model capable of classifying given regions of a protein's amino acid sequence (regions of low or no complexity).

## Assumptions: 
The project will be carried out using technologies such as Matlab, Deep Learning Toolbox and Bioinformatics Toolbox

## Motivation: 
To create an alternative form of prediction of LCR regions.

## Description of topic: 
Protein low complexity regions are fragments of an amino acid sequence that are characterized by tandem or multiple repeats of the same amino acid. 
While this was once thought to be of little importance, today's knowledge and research confirms links of these repeats to e.g. diseases such as Huntington's chorea.

## Expected results: 
A machine learning model program capable of accurate (relative to legacy programs such as SEG) prediction of protein regions of low complexity.
